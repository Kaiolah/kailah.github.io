           <h1>Activity Depot</h1>
           <p>This activity depot holds my summary and review of various activities I have done with my mom. Our relationship hasn't been perfect, but she is my only mother and I wouldn't trade her for the world. I love you, girl! </p>

  <p>September 23: I gave my mom $100 (not much, but what I was planning to spend on my nails and toes this week) to get herself some items. Se always has put me and my sisters' needs before her own. She has always been selfless, kind, and giving. Growing up, we didn't have much. I remember alsways being cautious about asking her to buy certain things because I knew she'd go out of the way, bending over backwards to get it done for me, even if that meants that she would be missing out on something for herself. It was so enjoyable to see her smiling as she tried on outfits. although I couldn't be with her physically, I felt so bonded and it was turly so much fun. Being able to treat my mom after years of her treating me touched me very deeply.</p>
