<h1> hi, i'm paul.</h1>

<h3>i tell bad jokes.</h3>

<body> I'm Kailah. I am a 20 year old artist, designer, and soon enough social worker. I have a million interests, but only one passion: helping people. I don't know what exactly I want to leave as a legacy, but I know that if I can combine my love for art, technology and social justice, it will be good. I was diagnosed with autism freshman year of college, I'm from Chicago, I think being called quirky is an insult, and I have the palette of a 3 year old. My shoes are never tied and my front teeth overlap a little but I'm always smiling. I hope you have fun looking through the things I've created in Grey's class.</body>
