<h3> I'm Kailah. I am a 20 year old artist, designer, and soon enough, social worker. <br> I have a million interests, but only one passion: helping people. <br> I don't know what exactly I want to leave as a legacy,
     but I know that if I can combine my love for art, technology and social justice, it will be good. <br> I was diagnosed with autism freshman year of college, I'm from Chicago, 
     I think being called quirky is an insult, and I have the palette of a 3 year old. My shoes are never tied and my front teeth overlap a little but I'm always smiling. <br> 
     I hope you have fun looking through the things I've created in Grey's class.</h3>
