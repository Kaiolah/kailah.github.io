<button class="accordion">week 3: Martin Paul Eve - Selections from Warez The Infrastructure and Aesthetics of Piracy</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Martin Paul Eve’s Warez: The Infrastructure and Aesthetics of Piracy, discusses the subculture of internet piracy and its digital location aka the “Scene.” Eve discusses this underground culture as consisting of rules and norms that made it more than just a trend. The most interesting part, in my eyes, was the chapter on aesthetics and the discussion of sampling. Sample culture often is spoken of in the context of music, but takes on a different position within the analogy of the “Scene.” I think that the idea that the discussion of intellectual property has advanced really from our original thoughts of just something we made. Do we get credit for things that we inspired others to do? Do we actually OWN anything in this life? </p>

<button class="accordion">week 4: Willa Köerner, Laurel Schwulst, & Édouard U - Selections from Creative Independent and Arena How Do You Use the Internet Mindfully</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Laurel Schwults’s essay, “My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?” was very thought-provoking in the sense that we use technology to find placement both physically (describing where we are positioned) and community groupings by interest, etc. I really enjoyed Shwult’s writing as they used so many similies to convey how websites function in our day-to-day lives. The website, while a website is, “a file or bundle of files,” there are so many possibilities for whom it can bring together and what can come out of these interactions. </p>

<button class="accordion">week 5: Alessandro Ludovico & Florian Cramer - Selections from Publishing from Post-Digital-Print</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>I really liked this week's reading, not just for the easy language (LOL) but also for the perspective that it provided on the internet and the digital world we live in. I found chapter 6 the most insightful and relevant, as I never really considered magazines and printed works as part of a network, only associating the word with media or electronic connectedness. I think that this chapter really emphasized how the internet functions as a community based on exchange and highlights how these exchanges have been a part of human relationships/interactions in the physical world long before.  </p>

<button class="accordion">week 6 : Ben Duvall - Selections from New Modernism(s)</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Ben Duvall's "New Modernism(s)" was pretty insightful to read as someone with an interest in UX/UI design. I found the chapter, "The Aesthetics of Refusal" to be particularly interesting because I think it really brought on some great points about how we make assumptions/judgments based on the visual, and how those characteristics play a role in our interactions with the world around us. This chapter made me think a lot about style (in terms of clothing, web design, and architecture) and how it is developed. I also began to think about why some styles have longevity, and others are only mere "trends". Is it the technology/methodology behind it that makes it stay relevant? Not the smoothest transition here but I also liked the discussion of the rejection of a style or "non-aesthetic" as being aesthetic. These sort of anti-mainstream ideas I feel expand into other things like music and also reflect the tension that we as human beings are constantly dealing with: The desire to fit in vs the desire to stand out. </p>

<button class="accordion">week 7: Bojana Coklyat & Shannon Finnegan - Alt-Text as Poetry Workbook</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The reading for this week was pretty cool, I enjoyed the interactive bits because it’s rare that you get to read something and really feel engaged outside of it being relatable. Thinking of alt text as poetry was really interesting from the perspective of someone whose vision and hearing are at a level to where it isn’t necessarily required for me to understand because it added a perspective I don’t always consider. I enjoyed the tips on writing alt text, specifically experimental spirit because it explained how the we all sort of process things a little differently. </p>

<button class="accordion">week 8: Metahaven - White Night Before A Manifesto & Seth Price - Dispersion</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Seth Price’s “Dispersion” was a cool read to have. It made me think a lot about the importance  of intention when we create, whether it be art, food, music or films. We actively make artistic choices with our clothes, and how elements of our outfits speak to other elements (ie shoe and bag coordination). I think this translates over to web design as we consider the user’s experience and interactions. On the flip side, just as something to consider, the user doesn’t always do what we want them to do, which leads to their curation of their own experience. </p>

<button class="accordion">week 9: David Reinfurt - Selections from A *New* Program for Graphic Design</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The piece from this week made me think a lot about logos and advertisements. Specifically the changes we’ve seen as logos have shifted from cramming the most eye-catching words/signal phrases and colors together to very minimal line work and muted colors. This article has a few that I really like https://www.dezeen.com/2016/08/31/minimalist-rebranding-design-logos-graphics/ Links to an external site.. It also makes me think if there’s anything that gets lost (outside of nostalgia) when we see logos change. I haven’t had the experience myself, but maybe for someone more visually impaired it could be more difficult, or conversely is it easier to interpret? And is a “minimal world” our future? </p>

<button class="accordion">week 11:  Neta Bomani & Sabii Bornologic - Beyond Dark Matter from Logic Issue 15 Beacons & Paul Saulellis - Performing the Feed.pdf</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>This was probably my favorite reading the art is so cute and fun. I found the message of the story to be applicable to the web, but also (and likely purposely) connected to life in itself. Understanding that community, however you define it, is there for you. the quote at the end, "Another way is always possible" reminds me a lot of math classes and CS courses I took at Dartmouth when I was a CS major, where our professor encouraged us to find alternate solutions to problems on homework/exams. I think it also speaks to the life and that our journeys are nonlinear, just because you didn't get something the first time or things didn't go as planned doesn't mean that you won't get that second chance.</p>

<button class="accordion">week 12: Hito Steyerl - Why Games Or Can Art Workers Think & Manuel Arturo Abreu - Incalculable Loss</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The reading “Why Games, or, Can art workers think” reminded me a lot of a conversation we had in my other design course last week on the topic of “Where do we draw the line between what is and isn’t art?” This sent us into a spiral of questions like “Does art have to have meaning, impact and purpose/intention?” and also if art has to mean something to everyone. And honestly, aster reading this, I still don’t have an answer. I did enjoy, though, the connection the author built between games and art I never through especially about video games from that pov.</p>

<button class="accordion">week 14: Boris Groys - Art on the Internet & Christine T. Wolfe - Computing in Crip Time from Logic Issue 16 Clouds</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>I really enjoyed the readings from this week because I think they brought many things into consideration to me when I think about being a "designer" or "artist." Boris Groys' Art on the Internet made me think a lot about how we use art on the internet, specifically as a mode of communication, and how art is duplicated or imitated to convey new and different messages, an example being turning things into memes. Groy's chapter also made me consider a lot about how we as individuals develop taste, interests and ultimately aesthetics. Christine Wolfe's Computing in Crip Time made me think about accessibility of course, but also how the technology has altered the pace of life in general. How having access to a computer can accelerate the information we take in, which alters our decision-making and relationship with self as well as others. </p>

<button class="accordion">week 15: Alyssa Battistoni - A Repair Manual for Spaceship Earth from Logic Issue 9 Nature & Wendy Hui Kyong Chun - On Software or the Persistence of Visual Knowledge</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Alyssa Battistoni’s A Repair Manual for Spaceship Earth made me think a lot about the things that we take for granted, and also the limits that technology has. The Biosphere 2  project pretty much represented how we are aware of the destruction we are causing, and instead of working on providing more sustainable methods, we just want to create more that will likely inevitably fuel the errors we have already made.  On the one had I think it’s very disappointing and selfish, but on the other hand, I think it furthers our ideas for designs, what we can design and how far can we really push things.</p>
