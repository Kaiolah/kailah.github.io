<p> In small groups of 2 or 3, students will work together to establish a system that individual students will then utilize to recreate an image with Binary, ASCII, or Unicode characters. Groups may reconvene to reassess their group’s systems or individual students may “fork the code” (within reason) to better serve their images. Final text images must be a minimum of 60 character rows/columns along the shortest edge.
