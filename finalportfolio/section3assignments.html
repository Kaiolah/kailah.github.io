Individually or in small groups of 2 or 3, students will design and write a program or script to be performed. This can be taken literally, as in your script is intended to be enlivened by actors. This can be taken loosely and all terms can be creatively interpreted. Regardless, all performances must incorporate learned principles of scripted “functions,” and must also include an element of “chance.”
 </div>
<button class="accordion">Goals </button>
<div class="panel">
<li>Plan — All scripts must include a written component. Will this be a literal script for actors? A set of instructions to be performed? A set of rules that can inform a dynamic experience? (5 pts)</li>
<li>Script — Your script must creatively interpret the logic of learned markup and programming languages, but does not need to be syntactically correct. (10 pts)</li>
<li>Execute — All performances must be able to be enacted for a minimum of 2 minutes (typically: 1 minute per page in a standard screenplay). If your duration exceeds 5 minutes, the entirety or continuation of your script must be adequately described or summarized. How will you critically and creatively engage your audience? (10 pts)</li>
<li>Document — You will create a single page website that appropriately documents your performance. (5 pts)</li></h2></div>

An API (Application Programming Interface) allows applications, tools, or services to safely “share” restricted data with other applications, tools, or services. The availability of this “public facing” data allows developers to build connected/supplementary platforms that may further ease or augment a user’s experience. In teams of two or three, students will work together to create and execute an interactive design tool that employs API linking with IFTTT Links to an external site.(If This; Then That). Teams must also design and develop a website that serves to promote this tool and to document its real-life application and usage.<br>
 </div>
<button class="accordion">Goals </button>
<div class="panel">

<li>Take time to research what applets are compatible with IFTTT. Ideate an assistive tool within these limitations to address a perceived problem (social, personal, political, etc). While researching, you may discover connections between apps/services that expand their capacities beyond familiar interactions. Explore the framework and restrictions of API linking (conditional queries, data and terms, actions and triggers, etc) between apps/tools to creatively generate new connections and interactions. What can be gained by linking two unrelated tools? What is lost in the process? (5 pts)</li>
<li>Realize/develop your concept as an IFTTT recipe. (5 pts)</li>
<li>Design a single-page website that functions to “promote” your speculative design concept and assistive tool. Your sites must demonstrate consistent messaging and styling to assist in communicating the underlying ideas (thoughts, feelings, etc) behind your concept and recipe. Treat this space as a demonstration and documentation of your project, but also as an elevator pitch that can inspire and garner interest. How can you convince others to use this tool?

    Students will create a website that adequately documents all class work: all projects and assignments (including reading responses) must be included in your final online portfolio. Your portfolio designs must utilize consistent styling, convey deliberate user interaction considerations, and include many elements learned from HTML, CSS, and p5.js. There will be several check-in critiques to assure progress and provide feedback.
</div>
<button class="accordion">Goals </button>
<div class="panel">

<li>Grow and develop your ideas alongside feedback and suggestions from each check-in critique (1 point each, 3 pts). You are welcome to start small with sketches and broad ideas, but you must demonstrate clear and rigorous progress throughout. (Critiques: 11/30, 12/7, 12/12, Final Due on 12/21)</li>
 <li> Work to creatively implement key concepts and learned techniques in a consistent manner that mindfully addresses your user while expressing both your design vision and ability. (3 pts)</li>
<li>Imaginatively document, archive, and display all class assignments and reading responses. (4 pts)</li></h2></div>
