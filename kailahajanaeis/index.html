    <h1> kailah a'janae is </h1>
   <h3><b>Bold, authentic, and loud,</b> I hail from the southside of Chicago. I am a passionate, curious, and vivacious person who has devoted my life to 3 S’s: Scholarship, Service, and Sympathy.

My interests take home at the intersection of Art, Technology, and Social Justice. In our forever-evolving world, it is key to understand the situations that impact us. By combining Design and Urban Studies, I hope to forge a path that generates new experiences for groups in underrepresented communities in the areas of Accessibility and Sustainability. With a background in Computer Science, Women’s, Gender and Sexuality Studies, and Africana Studies, I have collected an abundance of skills that contribute to my abilities to connect and creatively share stories of underrepresented communities. My goal is to take our world of theory and combine it with real-life experiences that prove projects for social justice must directly involve the communities they serve, not just in the solution, but every step of the way.

My plans after graduating from the University of Pennsylvania in December 2024 include pursuing a dual degree program receiving an MBA and MSW, to equip myself with the tools needed to tackle micro and macro-level social work from an Artist, Social Worker, and Business Professional point of view.

My work as a designer, community member, and leader reflects my deep passion and connectedness to Black culture – The culture that raised me and continues to shape my view of the world.
I would be remiss if I did not touch on my love for writing. It is my outlet, my first joy, and only peace. Raised by an English teacher, reading and writing have fueled my thirst for knowledge, to learn, share, and create a community of accessible education.
Outside of the academic realm, my hobbies include writing, painting, upcycling, and wellness studies. Ask me what book I am reading!
