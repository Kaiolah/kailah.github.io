 <h1>Where Black Girl Magic is Sometimes Blue</h1>
<h2>Where Black Girl Magic is Sometimes Blue a small zine that reflects the side of me I hide most from the world. As a perfectionist with crippling depression, it gets hard to keep a good poker face and really mask my emotions. This zine represents my blues, my sorrow and my pain spilled into a collection of song lyrics and images. It is a testimony to the struggle for perfection and the danger of always “having it together.”&nbsp;</ul></span>
