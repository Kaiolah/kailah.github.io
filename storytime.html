     <h1> Backslash Story</h1>
<p>You are a reverse solidus, aka “backslash.” The rest of your family is full of great solidi or soliduses. <br>

    While the rest of your family get ready for work at HTML, you remain at home.<br>
    
    White at home, you get curious and try out some tricks. You learn to walk on your hands with your feet in the air. You discover that, in this position, you look normal, no longer backwards. <br>
    
    Do you a) remain at home or b) test your luck in at HTML?<br>
    
    b) As you set off on your quest to test your luck at HTML, you encounter a slight problem. How will you disguise yourself? Can you even stand on your hands for long?<br>
    
    Do you a) work things out or b) decide you’ll never be able to work at HTML?<br>
    
    a) you decide to walk around with your pants on your head and see how far that gets you. when you arrive to HTML, they ask you for a badge that you don’t have.<br>
    
    Do you a) quit or b) say you’re the new guy?<br>
    
    b) As the mysterious “new guy” you get a temp ID and are told you’ll work with the closing paragraph tags. If you can get to higher ranks,you’ll be with the rest of the family members in the exclusive line break department. This was a place only top paragraph tag closers were invited to, where your great-great grandfather was a a big historical figure. <br>
    
    You’ve made it through half of the day. You think to yourself, “hey this has been pretty simple. It’s now time for your lunch break. Do you a) eat in the car or b) eat in the break room? <br>
    
    a) while eating in the car, you realize you’ve made a terrible mistake.. you parked next to your mother who is also on break. she reports you to the HTML editor and you are fired. you leave your mark as a red underline, a flaw in the system. <br>
    
    b) while eating in the break room, someone catches you suspiciously putting your sandwich as they were quoted “up your pants.” you are reported to the HTML editor and you are fired for inappropriate behavior. you leave your mark as a red underline, a flaw in the system. <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Colon Chronicles</h1>

    <p>You are a colon. The rest of the men in your family are great semicolons with distinctively long beards. <br>

        While the rest of the men in your family get ready for work at CSS, you remain at home. White at home, you get curious and try out some tricks. You discover that if you wear a fake beard, you look like the semi-colons in your family.<br>
        
        Do you a) remain at home or b) test your luck in at CSS?<br>
        
        b) As you set off on your quest to test your luck at CSS, you encounter a slight problem. How will you function with this fake beard? Will it look right on the Cascading Style-Sheet? Can you avoid the red squiggle?<br>
        
        Do you a) work things out or b) decide you’ll never be able to work at CSS?<br>
        
        a) you decide to tape your beard and see how far that gets you. when you arrive to CSS, they ask you for a badge that you don’t have.<br>
        
        Do you a) quit or b) say you’re the new guy?<br>
        
        b) As the mysterious “new guy” you get a temp ID and are told you’ll work towards the bottom of the page, with the other low-level statement closers. If you can get to higher ranks,you’ll be with the rest of the family members in the exclusive lines 1-10. This was a place only top statement closers were invited to, where your great-great grandfather was a a big historical figure. <br>
        
        You’ve made it through half of the day. You think to yourself, “hey this has been pretty simple. It’s now time for your lunch break. Do you a) eat in the car or b) eat in the break room?<br>
        
        a) while eating in the car, you realize you’ve made a terrible mistake.. the tape doesn’t hold up through your pastrami sandwich and your beard begins to slide off. you return to work hoping no one notices, but in the competitive environment the semi on line 2065 immediately notices and reports you. he gets bumped up to line 2064, and you are fired. you leave your mark as a red underline, a flaw in the system. <br>
        
        b) while eating in the break room, you drink your soup a little too quickly and it drips down your chin, loosening the tape. you head to the bathroom to quickly dry your face with a paper towel. your father comes out of the stall to wash his hands and peers at you. He cannot recognize you but says you “remind him of his son, but his son is a colon.” he wishes you luck starting out and never realizes it was you. <br>
