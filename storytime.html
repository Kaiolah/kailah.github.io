    <h1> A Semi-Colon for a day.</h1>

    <p> The year is 2005. CSS has been around for about 8 years now, but is still a relatively new job. They separate the tasks at work by colon (women) and semi-colon (men). You are a colon. The men in your family are great semicolons with distinctively long beards. However, you don't really identify as a colon. Your family doesn't know this, though.<br>

        While the rest of the colons and semi-colons in your family get ready for work at CSS, you remain at home. While at home, you get curious and try out some tricks. You discover that if you wear a fake beard, you look like the semi-colons in your family.<br>
        
        As you set off on your quest to test your luck at CSS, you encounter a slight problem. How will you function with this fake beard? Will it look right on the Cascading Style-Sheet? Can you avoid the red squiggle?<br>
        You decide to tape your beard and see how far that gets you. when you arrive to CSS, they ask you for a badge that you don’t have.<br>
        
        Open Bracket: sir, do you have your ID?<br>
        
       Curly Brackets had the toughest jobs of containing and overseeing the groups on the page.<br>
        Since colons and semi-colons have different jobs, your usual ID doesn't work to access this wing.<br>
        You[fake deep voice]: I have actually just been hired today, and need to get a badge.<br>
        
        Open Bracket looks down at his form<br>
        
        Open Bracket: Ah yes Mr. Swanson, we've been waiting for you. Here is your temp card. You'll have to get your picture taken later on today in the basement where the women work. Let me know if there's anything I can do to help you in your position. <br>
        
        
        As the “new guy” you get a temp ID and are told you’ll work towards the bottom of the page, with the other low-level statement closers. If you can get to higher ranks,you’ll be with the rest of the family members in the exclusive lines 1-10. This was a place only top statement closers were invited to, where your grandfather was a a big historical figure. <br>
        
        You’ve made it through half of the day. You think to yourself, “hey this has been pretty simple." It’s now time for your lunch break. <br>
        While eating in the break room, you drink your soup a little too quickly and it drips down your chin, loosening the tape. you head to the bathroom to quickly dry your face with a paper towel. your father comes out of the stall to wash his hands and peers at you. <br>
        He cannot recognize you <br>
        Father: first day?
        You: yea, how could you tell?
        Father: I made the mistake of wearing white my first day too, got mustard all over myself. Tried to tell my daughter the same, but she's a little hard headed just like her father <br>
        You: [nervous laughter] Sounds like me. 
        Fahter: you remind me of my daughter, but that doesn't make since because she would be a colon.” <br>
        he wishes you luck starting out and never realizes it was you. <br>
        </p>
