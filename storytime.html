    <h1> Colon Chronicles</h1>

    <p> The year is 2005. CSS has been around for about 8 years now, but is still a relatively new job. They separate the tasks at work by colon (women) and semi-colon (men). You are a colon. The men in your family are great semicolons with distinctively long beards. However, you don't really identify as a colon. Your family doesn't know this, though.<br>

        While the rest of the colons and semi-colons in your family get ready for work at CSS, you remain at home. While at home, you get curious and try out some tricks. You discover that if you wear a fake beard, you look like the semi-colons in your family.<br>
        
        As you set off on your quest to test your luck at CSS, you encounter a slight problem. How will you function with this fake beard? Will it look right on the Cascading Style-Sheet? Can you avoid the red squiggle?<br>
        You decide to tape your beard and see how far that gets you. when you arrive to CSS, they ask you for a badge that you don’t have.<br>
        
        Paren<br>
        
        b) As the mysterious “new guy” you get a temp ID and are told you’ll work towards the bottom of the page, with the other low-level statement closers. If you can get to higher ranks,you’ll be with the rest of the family members in the exclusive lines 1-10. This was a place only top statement closers were invited to, where your great-great grandfather was a a big historical figure. <br>
        
        You’ve made it through half of the day. You think to yourself, “hey this has been pretty simple. It’s now time for your lunch break. Do you a) eat in the car or b) eat in the break room?<br>
        
        a) while eating in the car, you realize you’ve made a terrible mistake.. the tape doesn’t hold up through your pastrami sandwich and your beard begins to slide off. you return to work hoping no one notices, but in the competitive environment the semi on line 2065 immediately notices and reports you. he gets bumped up to line 2064, and you are fired. you leave your mark as a red underline, a flaw in the system. <br>
        
        b) while eating in the break room, you drink your soup a little too quickly and it drips down your chin, loosening the tape. you head to the bathroom to quickly dry your face with a paper towel. your father comes out of the stall to wash his hands and peers at you. He cannot recognize you but says you “remind him of his son, but his son is a colon.” he wishes you luck starting out and never realizes it was you. <br>
