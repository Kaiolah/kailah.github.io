       <h1> morrison: mothering beyond the biological</h1>
       <h3>Morrison did not only raise her own two sons, but raised a generation of black authors. As an editor at Random House, she used her role as a platform to uplift writers around her. She published authors such as Gayl Jones, Toni Cade Bambara, Angela Davis, Chinua Achebe, and many others. Some of the authors she published had never been published in the United States before, which opened a new audience for them as writers. Outside of their work relationships, Morrison acted as a pillar of support, using her extra money to give to writers. Through this, she alongside a generation of brilliant Black authors, gave new life to Black women’s fiction and storytelling. </h3>

My mother is the first person I think about when I wake up. When I get good news, I want to share it with her. When I’m sad, I want to be around her even if in silence. My mother, even when she doesn’t understand, makes me feel like things are gonna be okay. That’s the only person I can come undone to, the best gift I could have in this lifetime. My mother is the definition of a superhero in every right. To Ms. MakeItHappen, Ms. IGotIt, Ms. TheWorldIsYours, you never forget to remind me who I am and how far I can go.
