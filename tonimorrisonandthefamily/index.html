   <h4>This website is 100% coded and created by me! I am a previous Computer Science major as well as Women's Gender and Sexuality Studies (modified with AAAS) major. My experiences in college as well as moving thorugh life as a Black woman raised by a single mother have really shaped my thoguhts on motherhood, as well as informed me to write about the subject. My goal within this website is to create a multimedia space that encourages us to consider the ways in which Morrison, along with other authors, artistsm activists, musicians and more, reflect on the highs, lows and joys of Black motherhood. I was really inspired by Leah Writhg Rigueur's "The Persistent Joy of Black Mothers" article written for The Atlantic. In it, Rigueur discusses how the existence of Black women, in the face of so many microaggressions, so much bigotry and so many hardships becomes a form of resistance and radical or "violent" joy.
            <br>I enter my own thoughts here, as Black mothers do not just raise children, but communities. Black mothers take care of everyone dating back to slavery, when they were forced to make sure Massa's babies were clothed and fed before their own. I witnessed my own mother make huge sacrifices as a single mother of three young girls, facing abuse, debt and discrimination. 
           <br>So while my website is an ode to all mothers, grandmothers, aunties and sistas, it is especially for the love my mother gave me when the world did not love her.</h4>
