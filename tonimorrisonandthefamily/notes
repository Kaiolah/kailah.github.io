   <h1> these are some brief notes about the site</h1>
   
   <h3> <ul> this website is built with HTML and CSS via GitHub </ul>
   <ul> the aesthetic choice is not out of laziness, but rather that the information is more pertinent than the design. as someone who is also a fan of minimalistic designs, i felt that adding more colors would be a distraction to not only the information, but the "two screen" affect i have created </ul>
   <ul>the two screen decision was made becuase i wanted to tell my story without interefering with the stories i was also presenting.</ul>
   <ul> i really hope my vision is clear to you all, and you enjoy it. thank you Professor Beavers, Matty and Natalia for your understanding, flexibility and grace.</ul>
