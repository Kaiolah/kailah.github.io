   <h4>In high school, everyone had jobs. With jobs, most kids also had cars. Not me though. We couldn’t afford to have two cars, hell we don’t even have a driveway for one car let alone two. My mother drove me back and forth to work any time I needed to. And for some months I had worked two jobs. She would drop me off at one, pick me up, get me lunch and take me to the other. I remember leaving out into the darkness at work, waiting for my mom’s headlights to become visible. Some nights she’d be the only car on because the rest of my coworkers had their own vehicles. She didn’t mind though. When I got into Dartmouth, my mother didn’t understand what an Ivy was, she was just happy I had gotten into a school and didn’t have to pay anything. When I became an AKA, she knew little about Black Greek Letter Organizations and was just happy I had found a community for me.
<br>
When I decided to transfer, my mother supported that too. And despite being a teacher with three kids, debt, and red eviction notices, she still makes a way to give me extra money so I can hang out (because Penn is full of wealthier people with money and free time). She never fully understood why I wanted to “keep up” with others, but did her best to make sure I knew that being different was okay. 
<br>
I owe my mom more than I can give her in this lifetime. For all the times she was at her lowest and never showed it because she needed to take care of her kids. For the times I was too young to understand why I couldn’t get the UGG boots with UGG on the back and mine were AIRWALKS from Payless. For the times I didn’t understand why my sister and I had to share our games for the DS.
